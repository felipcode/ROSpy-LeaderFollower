## To test it i opened 3 diferent terminals:
### One to run the .launch file ->
`$ cd ~catkin_ws`

`$ roslaunch /src/follow_/src/launch/two_tb3.launch`

### Another to run leader-follower file ->
`$ cd ~catkin_ws`

`$ rosrun follow_ turtlebot3_teleop_key.py`

### And a third to run the teleop of leader robot ->
`$ cd ~catkin_ws`

`$ rosrun follow_ turtlebot3_teleop_key.py`
